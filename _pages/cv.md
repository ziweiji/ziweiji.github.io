Education
======
* B.S. in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 2015 - 2019
* Ph.D Candidate in ECE Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 2019 - Present

Work experience
======
* **Meta FAIR:** Nov. 2024 - Apr. 2025, Paris, France
* Research Scientist Intern
* Mentor: Pascale Fung, Nicola Cancedda
* Discover linear "verbal uncertainty" feature in Large Language Model (LLM) representation space and calibrate via inference-time intervention to reduce hallucinations by 32\%. (Submitted to ACL 2025)
* Build a dynamic hallucination benchmark to evaluate LLMs on factual questions, both short and long-form, and evaluate their ability to abstain from answering questions about non-existent entities. (Submitted to ACL 2025)
* Build a video benchmark for high-level world modeling and long-horizon procedural planning. Given initial and final states, the task is to distinguish the properly ordered action sequence in different contexts. (Submitted to ICCV 2025)


* **Shanghai AI Lab:** Jul. 2023 - Jan. 2024, Shanghai, China
  * Research Scientist Intern
  * Mentor: Wenwei Zhang
  * Build an analytical hallucination annotation dataset in LLMs. Employing the dataset, we train hallucination annotators based on InternLM-7B/20B. (ACL 2024)
  * Scale analytical hallucination annotation progressively and improve the accuracy of the annotator with an iterative self-training framework. And apply the annotator for hallucination mitigation. (NeurIPS 2024)
  


<!-- * **Research Intern:** Sept. 2017 - Feb. 2018 
  * Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Xiangshui Miao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%BC%AA%E5%90%91%E6%B0%B4/5125689), and [Prof. Yuhui He](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/heyuhui/zh_CN/skxx/872850/content/2356.htm)
  
  * Numerical simulation of electrokinetic phenomena in nano fluidics.
  * Publish two papers about the impact of membrane surface charges and ionization equilibrium of weak electrolytes
