I received a Bachelor's Degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and a Ph.D. Degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk). 

My research interests lie primarily in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I mainly work on Hallucination in NLG, focusing on improving the generation tasks' faithfulness. I have experience in Dialogue Generation, Question Generation, Named Entity Recognition, Multimodal (Vision-Language) Generation, and Fake News Detection.
